I have created a native Kotlin app in android studio called Flashcard app. It is designed to help students study for history tests since they learn better with flashcards.It consists of 7 screens and 5 True/false questions. Each question gets its own screen and gives the user feedback at the bottom of the screen. The app also consists of a welcome screen in which you start the quiz and a review page in which you can either review the quiz or exit the app with the exit button.

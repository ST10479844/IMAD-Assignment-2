I have created a native Kotlin app in android studio called Flashcard app. It is designed to help students study for history tests since they learn better with flashcards.It consists of 7 screens and 5 True/false questions. Each question gets its own screen and gives the user feedback at the bottom of the screen. The app also consists of a welcome screen in which you start the quiz and a review page in which you can either review the quiz or exit the app with the exit button.
Here are screenshots of my app running in the emulator:

This is the welcome page and it has a start button which starts the quiz.

This shows question 1 with no feedback

This shows that the user selected the correct answer and the app gives feedback to the user that the answer is correct.
